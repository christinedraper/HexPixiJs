HexPixiJs
=========
Basic Hex Grid For PixiJS. Version 0.40 (alpha).

HexPixiJs is a simple library written to give hex grid based game developers a jump start. This library will be updated periodically but there is currently no roadmap of features. Feel free to request features.


Disclaimer
----------
This is not supposed to be and end-all solution for making hex grid based games. There is currently no documentation, but the code is fairly simple so I believe there is value for some developers. 

Troubleshooting
---------------
I realize there is a CORS (cross origin resource sharing) issue if you are trying to view this without a webserver. In otherwords, if you download the files and double click index.html, the texture might not load.
